          <div class="faq-list">
            <details>
              <summary>1. Can this service be offered online?</summary>
              <p>No colour analysis is only offered in person. This is because colours shift on screen, and the effect of drapes can only be accurately judged in natural daylight. To give you the most precise results, the session must be face to face.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>2. Does my colour analysis stay true for a lifetime?</summary>
              <p>Not necessarily. Your best colours may evolve over time. Factors like ageing, changes in skin clarity, greying or colouring your hair, and other natural shifts in your colouring can alter what suits you best. For most people, the analysis remains relevant for several years, but it can be revisited as your features change.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>3. What do I get after the session?</summary>
              <p>You’ll receive a personalised colour swatch book with your best colours included. This acts as your style guide, making shopping and outfit building easier. Many clients describe it as a “cheat sheet” they can carry everywhere.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>4. How long does the session take?</summary>
              <p>Typically, a session lasts 120 minutes, depending on your needs and questions.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>5. Do I need to wear or bring anything specific to the session?</summary>
              <p>It’s best to come with a makeup-free face, so your natural colouring is visible.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>6. Can men benefit from colour analysis too?</summary>
              <p>Absolutely. Colour analysis is not gendered, men often find it especially useful for building versatile work wardrobes, investing in the right shirts and ties, or simplifying everyday choices.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>7. How soon can I start using my results?</summary>
              <p>Immediately. Most clients find their shopping confidence transforms overnight they stop wasting money on colours that drain them, and instead buy pieces that instantly elevate their look.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>8. Will I be restricted to a small set of colours?</summary>
              <p>Not at all. You’ll get a wide palette that suits you, with tips on how to wear brighter, neutral, or unexpected shades. Think of it as expanding your options with clarity, not limiting them.</p>
